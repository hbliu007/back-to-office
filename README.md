## Claude Code + BTO

You use **Claude Code** at home. Your beefy GPU machine is at the office. BTO bridges them:

```
Home (MacBook)          Aliyun Relay           Office (GPU Machine)
bto connect ──────────> relay.bto.asia ──────> bto daemon
   │                        │                       │
   │── ssh -p 2222 ─────────────────────────────────>│
   │                                                │
   │── claude (Claude Code on remote GPU) ───────────>│
```

No VPN. No public IP. No port forwarding. Just P2P magic.
## The Problem

You're at a coffee shop. You need to SSH into your office dev machine — the one with your GPU, your data, your environment. But it's behind a corporate firewall.

**Your options today:**

- **VPN** — Ask IT, wait days, deal with split tunneling headaches
- **FRP / Ngrok** — Set up a public server, configure port forwarding, manage tokens
- **Tailscale** — Install on every device, depend on third-party DERP relay servers

You just want to type one command and get a shell. That's what BTO does.

## The Solution

```
bto connect office-213
```

That's it. BTO creates a P2P tunnel through NAT and firewalls, gives you a local port, and you SSH through it. No VPN, no port forwarding, no firewall rules, no third-party dependencies.

**~1,100 lines of C++. ~1 MB binary. One job, done well.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Similar to [bore](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore) and [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), except BTO is built for one specific use case — **remote SSH access to office machines** — and does it with P2P tunnels instead of requiring a public relay server. That's all it does: no more, and no less.

## Get Started in 30 Seconds

### Install

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbliu007/back-to-office/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Office Machine <sub>(run once, keep alive)</sub>

```console
$ bto daemon --did office-213 --relay relay.bto.asia:9700
  ✓ Registered as office-213
  ✓ Listening for incoming connections
```

### Your Laptop <sub>(from anywhere)</sub>

```console
$ bto connect office-213
  ✓ Connected via P2P tunnel
  ✓ Listening on localhost:2222

$ ssh -p 2222 user@127.0.0.1
user@office-213:~$   # You're in.
```

> [!TIP]
> **Fuzzy matching** — `bto 213` or `bto office` works too.

## How It Compares

| | BTO | FRP | Tailscale | SSH + VPN |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Setup time** | **30 sec** | ~10 min | ~5 min | Hours |
| **Public server required** | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Port forwarding** | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Self-hosted** | Fully | Fully | Partially | Fully |
| **3rd-party dependency** | None | None | DERP servers | VPN provider |
| **Binary size** | **~1 MB** | ~15 MB | ~50 MB | N/A |
| **Memory usage** | **< 10 MB** | ~30 MB | ~100 MB | N/A |
| **Mobile support** | Termux | No | App | App |
| **One-line install** | Yes | Partial | Yes | No |

**When to choose BTO over alternatives:**

- You want **SSH access to office machines**, not a full mesh VPN
- You want **zero infrastructure** — no public server, no cloud account, no IT approval
- You want **minimal footprint** — a single ~1 MB binary with no dependencies
- You want **full control** — self-host the relay, own your data

## How It Works

BTO is built on [PeerLink](https://github.com/hbliu007/peerlink), a P2P networking library. Each device registers a DID (Decentralized Identifier) with a lightweight relay. The relay helps devices discover each other and establish direct P2P tunnels — even behind NAT.

```
Your Laptop                  Relay Server               Office Machine
(bto connect)             (relay.bto.asia:9700)          (bto daemon)
     │                            │                           │
     │── REGISTER home-001 ──────►│                           │
     │◄── OK ────────────────────│                           │
     │                            │                           │
     │── CONNECT office-213 ────►│                           │
     │                            │── INCOMING home-001 ────►│
     │                            │                           │
     │◄═══════════ P2P Tunnel Established ══════════════════►│
     │                            │                           │
     │── SSH traffic (encrypted) ─────────────────────────────►│
     │◄── SSH traffic (encrypted) ─────────────────────────────│
```

The relay only brokers the initial handshake. Once the P2P tunnel is established, **all traffic flows directly between your devices** — the relay never sees your data.

## Usage

```bash
# Connect (the main thing you'll do)
bto office-213              # Fuzzy match — "bto 213" works too
bto connect office-213      # Explicit connect

# Daemon (run on the office machine)
bto daemon --did office-213 --relay relay.bto.asia:9700

# Device management
bto list                    # List configured peers
bto add office-215          # Add a peer

```

## Mobile — SSH from Your Phone

BTO runs on Android via [Termux](https://termux.dev). SSH into your office from your phone:

```console
$ pkg install curl
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbliu007/back-to-office/main/install.sh | bash
$ bto 213
  ✓ Connected to office-213
  ✓ Listening on localhost:2222
```

## Configuration

`~/.bto/config.toml` — simple, human-readable:

```toml
did = "home-mac"
relay = "relay.bto.asia:9700"

[peers.office-213]
  did = "office-213"

[peers.office-215]
  did = "office-215"
```
